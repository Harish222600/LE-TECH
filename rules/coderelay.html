          <h6>Basic rules about this event:</h6>
          <p>
            Code Relay is a competitive debugging event where teams of four,
            each coding in different languages, race against the clock to fix
            code bugs in a relay-style challenge. <br />

            Brief Description: <br />
            Code Relay is an intense coding competition where multiple teams of
            four compete simultaneously. Each team member specializes in a
            different programming language and must debug their assigned code.
            The event follows a relay formatâ€”once a member completes their task,
            they pass the challenge to the next team member. The team that
            successfully fixes all bugs first wins. If no team completes all
            debugging tasks within 6 minutes, the team with the most fixed bugs
            within the time limit will be declared the winner and move to the
            next round. <br />

            Rules & Regulations: <br />

            -Team Composition: Each team consists of four members, each using a
            different programming language. <br />
            -Match Format: All teams compete at the same time. <br />
            -Debugging Task: Each team member must fix a bug in their respective
            coding language. <br />
            - Relay System: Once a team member completes their task, they pass
            the challenge to the next member and do not participate again in
            that round. <br />
            - Winning Criteria: The first team to successfully fix all bugs is
            declared the winner. <br />
            - Elimination: The teams with the least number of fixed bugs or the
            slowest completion time are eliminated. <br />
            - Fair Play: No external help (e.g., internet, AI tools) is allowed
            during the contest. <br />
            - Time Limit: If no team finishes within the time limit, the team
            with the most fixed bugs moves forward. <br />
            - Judging Panel: A panel of judges will verify the correctness of
            the fixes before confirming the winners. <br />

            This ensures all teams compete at the same time while maintaining a
            fair and competitive environment. Let me know if you'd like any more
            refinements! ðŸš€
